# Streamlit Project: A ML App using Sci-kit Learn's RandomForestRegressor() Function

This project was done in order for me to familiarize myself with Python's web app development capabilities. **Streamlit** is an open source Python library that provides a web app framework for data science and machine learning content. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Keras, PyTorch, and more! 

The content for this project was inspired by ["The Data Professor"](https://github.com/dataprofessor). The main part of this project was learning how to put everything together in order to actually deploy and provide a public website. Installing, importing, and using Python libraries is typically executed on an individual's local environment, so we need the "requirements.txt" file that specifies the libraries we want to utilize in our actual public web app. All relevant files would need to be part of the same repository in order to create a public web app on Streamlit.

You will be able to actively interact with this web app by adjusting the given hyperparameters for the `RandomForestRegressor()` function. You can use the example dataset (from sci-kit learn) provided on the website to test out the features of the application. You can also import your own CSV file to perform analysis on! Note that your CSV file should be organized in a manner where your target (output) variable is the last column of the dataset.
